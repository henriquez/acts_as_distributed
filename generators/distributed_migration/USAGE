Description:
	The audited migration generator creates a migration to add the distribute table.

Example:  (note don't need the path for 'distributed_migration')
    ./script/generate distributed_migration add_distribute_table

    This will create a migration in db/migrate/.  Run "rake db:migrate" to update your database.
